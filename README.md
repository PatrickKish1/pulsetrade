## System Architecture

### **Workflow Overview**

1. **User Registration & Onboarding**:

   - Users create accounts, connect their MT5 profiles, and configure AI settings.
   - Blockchain wallets are linked for decentralized interactions.

2. **AI-Driven Operations**:

   - AI analyzes market data and generates trade signals.
   - Signals are sent to users for approval or executed autonomously.

3. **Trade Execution**:

   - Manual trades are initiated via the MT5 API.
   - AI trades are directly executed and reflected in the dashboard.

4. **Profit Sharing**:

   - Smart contracts ensure automatic profit distribution between trade admins and sub-accounts.
   - Virtual balances are updated after each trade.

5. **Analytics & Reporting**:
   - Users view performance metrics, trade history, and profit/loss reports.
   - Admins monitor sub-account activities and overall portfolio performance.
